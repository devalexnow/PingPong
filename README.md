# **Drag and Drop**
### made in JavaScript

## **About the project**

The project:
1. Uses **a drag and drop mechanism**
2. Is updated **in local storage**
3. Allows you to **edit and delete** elements
 
## **How it works**

The main goal of this project is to showcase **the drag-and-drop API.** The Kanban board is divided into four different columns: backlog (to do), in progress (doing), complete (done), and on hold. The items or tasks in each column are able to be moved between columns.

If you click on the item, **the column lights up,** and if you drag it over a different column, it also lights up to show that you can let it go there. The project also uses content editable attributes in order to **add and modify** items. You can click „+Add item" in the column, fill out some text, and press „Save Item". Then you will see a new item in this column. 

You can also **edit** every item — just click it, change, and click outside of that box. To **delete** the item, click it, backspace everything, and click outside of it.
