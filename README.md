## **How it works**

I recreated the classic pong game in the browser. It **starts in a loop,** and the computer doesn’t move until you do. When you slide into the play area, the cursor disappears, and you’re **taking over** the bottom paddle. 

As soon as you make contact with the ball, you’re actually able to play against **a very basic computer AI.**

The score is updated on the left side whenever you score a point or whenever the computer scores a point. Then **the ball resets** in the center again.

If one player reaches 5 points, you will see **a gameover screen** that tells you who won: the computer or you. It also has a „play again" button that allows you to seamlessly restart another game.
